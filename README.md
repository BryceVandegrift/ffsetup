# ffsetup

Firefox Setup Script

Setup Firefox automatically with privacy respecting settings.
This script automatically installs the Arkenfox user.js to Firefox.

Just run:

``` sh
curl -fLO "https://git.sr.ht/~bpv/ffsetup/blob/master/ffsetup.sh"
sh ffsetup.sh
```

## Why?

Because I'm tired of manually setting up and configuring Firefox settings
every time I install a new system. This makes things much easier.
