# ffsetup

Firefox Setup Script

Setup Firefox automatically with privacy respecting settings.
This script automatically installs the Arkenfox user.js to firefox.

## Why?

Because I'm tired of manually setting up and configuring Firefox settings
every time I install a new system. This makes things much easier.
